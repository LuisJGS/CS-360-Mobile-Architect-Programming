Work through the creation of an Inventory App.

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
We were ask to choose and app to develop. In my case I choose to create an Inventory app. The app consist in a database for storing item
in our inventory. The app have a function to notify the users with a sms when the inventory is low, and have a database to store users information.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
UI is as simple as possible without a lot to get distracted. Is start from the login page and takes the user to the main page. In the main page you can choose to add items, manage the sms notification or simply log out. that main page have the inventory items once the items are added.
If you choose to add items to inventory it will take you to a screen so you can add the item name and the quantity.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My process is starting by creating a plan for the app, what was my expectation and my goals. Design the UI and then worte the backend code.
Techniques for me was researching a lot to understand how the back end and the UI connected. It is always good to keep learning so, researching is something I will always take with me for future projects.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I test small part of the code. Check function by function to see if everything was working correctly. It is important go part by part because is easier and save time. If we wait for the end it will take a lot more time to check part by part for functionality.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I need to innovate in every part of my process, I understand school is the first step and that time manage is different since our daily life take the mayority of the time right now, but if I want to be a developer I need to put more time into the process.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think UI was the easiest part of the project. I have a lot to learn of backend. At the end I need to keep working to polish my skills on both sides.
